# art-website
Backup of my custom art-focused website project -- hosted on https://aconfuseddragon.neocities.org/index.html

I built this site to act as a fun art portfolio so it's not tech focused, I wanted to go back to the basics and try to do most of the stuff I needed with CSS/HTML in order to learn them.
It's hosted on neocities since I think it's a neat site that includes social media features that stand-alone sites can lack (but without the full craziness of social media).
